'Slope is (b) -0.00925719196078415
y-intercept is (a) 4.731434285337494
Thus the decay constant is negative of the slope  0.00925719196078415
The mean lifetime of the sample is  108.02411835427607
The error in the lifetime is 11.840129286515129
The chi-sqaure value is  15.17084059456292
The value of chi-square critical at 95 lof is  1.86 Thus we reject the null hypothesis and the linear fit is not a good fit'
